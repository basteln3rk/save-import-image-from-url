Allows you save an image from a remote URL to the WordPress media gallery, create local thumbnails and rename image.

== Description ==

This plug-in replaces the built-in "Import from URL" media upload tab to allow you to download an image from a remote URL into the WordPress media gallery. Thumbnails for the remote image are created locally, and after upload you are able to add custom media attributes (like caption, title) and insert the image into your blog post.

List of Features:

* Directly include a remote image into a blog post without having to save it to your computer locally
* Be a better internet citizen: avoid hotlinking images with ease!
* Rename image after download
* Full integration with media library - including creation of thumbnail images

== Screenshots ==

1. Specify the URL of the image and the local rename you want to use

2. After the image has been uploaded and resized, add extra attributes and insert into post or set as featured image

== Installation ==

This plugin has no dependencies other than WordPress 4.2+ (although it may work with earlier versions, this is not tested).

For installation, follow the general [plugin installation guidelines](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins).

== Credits ==

* Builds on the idea of the [Grab & Save](https://wordpress.org/plugins/save-grab/) plugin, but compatible with WordPress 4.2+ and support for thumbnails
* Free plugin brought to you by [flexponsive](https://www.flexponsive.net)
